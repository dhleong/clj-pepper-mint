# clj-pepper-mint

A Clojure library for mint.com, ported from my
[pepper-mint](https://github.com/dhleong/pepper-mint) library.
This is my first Clojure project, so it's liable to be rough
around the edges, not follow best practices, and/or experience
breaking changes frequently.

## Usage

```clojure
(if-let [creds (login "user" "pass")]
    (get-transactions creds))
```
